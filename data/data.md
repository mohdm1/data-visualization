The geojson dataset from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson contains the pertinent information of all the reported earthquakes throughout the world. For the purposes of this project, the key important values are longitude and latitude so that the leaflet JavaScript service can place the locations on the map, the magnitude or strength of the earthquake so it can be numerically evaluated and the "place" value which contains the name of the location where the earthquake occured. 
Additionally, the USGS Earthquake page located at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php contains detailed explanations for the formatting of the geojson dataset. 
The USGS Earthquake page located at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/terms.php lists definitions of the terms for defining the magnitude of an earthquake. The most common measurement for earthquakes used in the project is the Local, ML, ml or the Richter scale. 
N= North, S= South, E = East, West = West. The cardinal directions can be combined so for example, "NNW" = North by North West or "ESE" East by South East.
